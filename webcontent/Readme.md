# Adding xAPI to the Game

## Purpose
This small tutorial will allow you to see how to store interactions with 
the game in an xAPI LRS. It uses the [ADL xAPIWrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper) to make sending statements to the 
LRS easier. Although this is a small tutorial it shows you how to:  
  1.  include the xAPI Wrapper in an HTML page,  
  2. configure the xAPI Wrapper with the LRS and client credentials,  
  3. send statements to the LRS,  
  4. include extensions in the statement, and  
  5. use registration and context activities to group statements.
